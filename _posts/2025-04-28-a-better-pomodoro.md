[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), work 25 minutes, rest 5 minutes; Simple, and work well enough. But I still often not achieving much with it, or unable to focus through it.

Its fundamental logic:

1. Get started doing things, knowing it won't take long and award with a break.
2. Giving a natural time block, prevent overspending time on single task without realising it.

Knowing the root reasonings, we can optimise it:

1. Start highest priority task, start a stopwatch, work until distracted, rest for 1/5 of the working time. This makes the tasks easy and keep us going.
2. Keep progressing and increase the work time, until getting into [Flow State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEN2ceXyi-s), then just set a suitable timer to give the task a boundary. This prevents the rest every 25 minutes breaking our flow.

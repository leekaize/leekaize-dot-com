It's the last day of 2024, and it feels fitting to reflect on the single word that has most impacted the world this year — AI. It has undeniably been a game-changer. However, I've noticed something unsettling within myself lately: an over-reliance on it. I've begun to feel like I'm outsourcing my thinking, and it's turning me into a master procrastinator.

## The AI Procrastination Trap

AI is seductive. It gives you answers _fast_. Need a summary? Done. Need an outline? Boom. But this **instant gratification** started to replace the hard, focused thinking that leads to real understanding — the **deep work**.

I'd spend hours tweaking AI outputs, feeling busy but not truly productive. It was like running on a hamster wheel. I'd get a decent essay written by an AI, but had I actually learned anything? Sure, it looked good, but where was _my_ voice, _my_ understanding?

## My "Aha!" Moment

I realized I was using AI to avoid the tough stuff: creative thinking, problem-solving, the struggles that come with real learning. I was letting the machine do the heavy lifting, and my own mental muscles were dying.

Here's how I knew I was in trouble:

- Endless tweaking of AI-generated stuff without adding much of my own.
- Using AI as an escape whenever a task got challenging.
- A nagging feeling that my own thinking skills were getting rusty.

## AI: Friend or Foe?

The problem isn't AI itself. It's how I was using it. I needed to see it as a tool to _enhance_ my work, not replace it.

Now, when I open an AI tool, I stop and ask myself: "Why am I using this? How can it help me do _my_ best work, not _do_ the work for me?"

One simple trick has been a game-changer. Before I ask AI to summarize something, I:

1. **Skim it myself.**
2. **Jot down my own quick summary.**
3. **Then, and only then, see what the AI comes up with, and compare with mine.**

This keeps me engaged and helps me actually learn.

## Getting My Brain Back in Gear

I'm retraining myself to focus and do the deep work I was avoiding. Here's what's helping:

- **Time Blocking:** I schedule focused work time without AI.
- **Active Reading:** I take notes, ask questions, and really engage with what I'm reading.
- **Handwritten Notes:** Old school, but it works! Writing by hand helps me remember and understand better.
- **Reflection:** I regularly check in with myself: Am I using AI as a tool or an escape?

## Using AI the Right Way (For Me)

AI can be a great brainstorming partner or help with outlines. And it's a lifesaver for editing and proofreading. But it's important to remember that we are still in control.

I know others find AI a huge productivity booster. And that's great! It's about finding what works for _you_.

## The Takeaway

This whole experience has been a wake-up call. I'm learning to use AI intentionally, **mindfully**, so I can utilise its power without losing my own. It's about rediscovering the joy of thinking for myself.

**A small challenge:** Resist the urge to immediately use an AI tool. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and try to work on the task yourself before resorting to AI assistance. See how it feels.

And yeah, this post was still touched up by AI. It's a journey, and I'm still learning to find the right balance. Hopefully, my future posts will be even more genuinely me.

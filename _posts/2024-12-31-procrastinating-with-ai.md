It's the last day of 2024, and it feels fitting to reflect on the single word that has most impacted the world this year — AI. It has undeniably been a game-changer. However, I've noticed something unsettling within myself lately: an over-reliance on it. I've begun to feel like I'm outsourcing my thinking, and it's turning me into a [master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

## The AI Procrastination Trap

AI gives you answers _fast_. Need a summary? Done. Need an outline? Boom. But this **instant gratification** started to replace the hard, focused thinking that leads to real understanding — the [deep work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7V76Ky-_v8).

I'd spend hours tweaking AI outputs, feeling busy but not truly productive. It was like running on a hamster wheel. Sure, everything looked good, but where was _my_ voice, _my_ understanding?

## So, how to use AI?

The problem isn't AI itself. It's how I was using it. I needed to see it as a tool to _enhance_ my work, not replace it.

Now, often when I open an AI tool, I would stop and ask myself: "Why am I using this? How can it help me do _my_ best work, not _do_ the work for me?"

Before I ask AI to summarize something, I:

1. Skim it myself
2. Jot down my quick summary
3. Then, and only then, see what the AI comes up with, and compare it with mine

This keeps me engaged and helps me learn.

AI can be a great brainstorming partner or help with outlines. And it's a lifesaver for editing and proofreading. But it's important to remember that we are still in control.

## The Takeaway

I'm learning to use AI intentionally, **mindfully**, so I can utilize its power without losing my own. It's often about re-discovering the joy of thinking for myself.

**A small challenge:** Resist the urge to immediately use an AI tool. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and try to work on the task yourself before resorting to AI assistance. See how it feels.

And yeah, this post was still touched up by AI. It's a journey, and I'm still learning to find the right balance.

For those who have never used RSS, it is a tool that allows us to subscribe to feeds from different sources: News, YouTube, Organisation Updates, Personal Blogs etc.

It doesn't push endless recommendations, competing for likes count, using tricks for better SEO, fulfill criterias to get promoted on specific platforms, etc.

It simply serves the original intent of the Internet and social media, to share information to interested audience. And this is not even a "new technology", RSS existed since 1999. It is the earlier, better, less corrupted form of social media.

Many sources of information still support RSS and might even be reviving in the current trend of digital minimalist.

To start using it, sign up for free RSS Aggregators. I would say [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is most frictionless one, just use their "Follow Sources" feature, find a blog/website you like, Subscribe to it then you'll start receiving latest post in your feed. All of the YouTube channel can also be subscribed this way, just put their channel link there.

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/feedly-casey.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

Below are example of feeds. For YouTube, it will show just the video and description and nothing else.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/feedly-casey-post.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/feedly-waitbutwhy-post.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

A good place to start reading is the Seth Godin's Blog, it shows how a blog posts can be quick, yet deep, such as [his post](https://seths.blog/2025/04/an-eroding-sense-of-wonder/) today.

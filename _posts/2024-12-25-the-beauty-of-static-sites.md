## What is a Static Website?

Pre-built website that directly deliver to user when accessed, therefore:

- Fast—No one likes to wait, staring at a blank website.
- Secure—Simpler and has less attack surface for hacker.

Noted: Static doesn't mean no user interaction possible, you can still have comment sections, forms, or even interactive elements using JavaScript, but the core HTML structure is pre-built.

## How does Jekyll makes it simple?

- Directly use markdown, not having to go through the messy HTML file.
- Use the community-support themes that suit your taste.
- Directly push it live on GitHub Pages for free!

## What are the overall steps of building Jekyll website?

It is essentially just some folder with some files:

- config files for some basic stuff
- content files in markdown
- template files for the looks of the site

Jekyll will build the website from these source files.

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages?

We don't have to take care of any server-side stuff, GitHub directly host all the final HTML, CSS etc. It's all done in two steps:

- Create GitHub repository.
- Push the files to the repository.
- Use GitHub Actions to automate the process.

## How and why should we blog?

It's an authentic way to get connected with people with same interests. We should make it a simple, non-tech-savvy place for sharing the thinking process and ideas. Remember the tech stuffs are just tools.

We are all expert of our experiences, through the writing process, we organise our thoughts into something humanely resonates with others. Sharing what you experienced, the a-ha moments, not pretending to be some guru. And through this reflection, we often learn a lot for ourselves too.

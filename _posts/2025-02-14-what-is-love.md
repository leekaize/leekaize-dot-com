**An Open Letter to My Beloved Manda on Valentine’s Day**

What is love? If we don't have our own answer to this, what does it even mean when we tell our loved ones, "I Love You"?

Love is not just about feeling good, not just a word you say, not merely an action, nor simply the willingness to sacrifice. Those are the results of love, but not its essence.

Love is the ultimate force of living. You are the force that inspires me to embrace life to the fullest; we are the light that warms each other on our darkest days, and love is the deepest promise that we will never be alone.

No matter what hardships life throws at us, we still run towards each other—actively, passionately, and steadfastly! We accept nature's invitation and God's calling, to share our hope and embrace every day.

We will combine our strengths and complement one another. I strive to be not just someone with status, but a devoted father, a loving husband, and a caring son.

- Provide for our family, putting it before everything else.
- Protect you, ensuring that nothing in the world can hurt you.
- Lead our family towards our ultimate purpose and vision.

Happy Valentine's Day, my love.

It has undeniably been a game-changer. However, I’ve noticed something unsettling within myself lately: an over-reliance on it. I’ve begun to feel like I’m outsourcing my thinking, and it’s turning me into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">master procrastinator</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-ai-procrastination-trap">The AI Procrastination Trap</h2> <p>AI gives you answers <em>fast</em>. Need a summary? Done. Need an outline? Boom. But this <strong>instant gratification</strong> started to replace the hard, focused thinking that leads to real understanding — the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7V76Ky-_v8">deep work</a>.</p> <p>I’d spend hours tweaking AI outputs, feeling busy but not truly productive. It was like running on a hamster wheel. Sure, everything looked good, but where was <em>my</em> voice, <em>my</em> understanding?</p> <h2 id="so-how-to-use-ai">So, how to use AI?</h2> <p>The problem isn’t AI itself. It’s how I was using it. I needed to see it as a tool to <em>enhance</em> my work, not replace it.</p> <p>Now, often when I open an AI tool, I would stop and ask myself: “Why am I using this? How can it help me do <em>my</em> best work, not <em>do</em> the work for me?”</p> <p>Before I ask AI to summarize something, I:</p> <ol> <li>Skim it myself</li> <li>Jot down my quick summary</li> <li>Then, and only then, see what the AI comes up with, and compare it with mine</li> </ol> <p>This keeps me engaged and helps me learn.</p> <p>AI can be a great brainstorming partner or help with outlines. And it’s a lifesaver for editing and proofreading. But it’s important to remember that we are still in control.</p> <h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2> <p>I’m learning to use AI intentionally, <strong>mindfully</strong>, so I can utilize its power without losing my own. It’s often about re-discovering the joy of thinking for myself.</p> <p><strong>A small challenge:</strong> Resist the urge to immediately use an AI tool. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and try to work on the task yourself before resorting to AI assistance. See how it feels.</p> <p>And yeah, this post was still touched up by AI. It’s a journey, and I’m still learning to find the right balance.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="technology"/><category term="ai,"/><category term="productivity,"/><category term="deep-work,"/><category term="mindfulness,"/><category term="technology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've realized that AI, while helpful, was turning me into a procrastinator.

You can still have comment sections, forms, or even interactive elements using JavaScript, but the core HTML structure is pre-built.</p> <h2 id="how-does-jekyll-make-it-simple">How does Jekyll make it simple?</h2> <ul> <li>Use Markdown, there is no need to go through the messy HTML/CSS/JavaScript file.</li> <li>Use the community-support themes that suit your taste.</li> <li>Push it live on GitHub Pages for free!</li> </ul> <h2 id="overall-steps">Overall Steps</h2> <p>It is essentially just some folder with some files:</p> <ul> <li>Config files for some basic stuff</li> <li>Content files in Markdown</li> <li>Template files for the looks of the site</li> </ul> <p>Jekyll will build the website from these source files.</p> <h2 id="how-do-you-deploy-to-github-pages">How do you deploy to GitHub Pages?</h2> <p>We don’t have to take care of any server-side stuff, GitHub directly hosts all the final HTML, CSS, etc. It’s all done in two steps:</p> <ul> <li>Create a GitHub repository.</li> <li>Push the files to the repository.</li> <li>Use GitHub Actions to automate the process.</li> </ul> <h2 id="how-and-why-should-we-blog">How and why should we blog?</h2> <p>It’s an authentic way to get connected with people with the same interests. We should make it a simple, non-tech-savvy place for sharing the thinking process and ideas. Remember the tech stuffs are just tools.</p> <p>We are all experts in our experiences, through the writing process, we organize our thoughts into something that humanely resonates with others. Sharing what you experienced, the a-ha moments, not pretending to be some guru. Through this reflection, we often learn a lot for ourselves too.</p> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">Tania Rascia Article</a>.
